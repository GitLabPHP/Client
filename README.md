A PHP Wrapper for use with the [Gitlab API](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/tree/master/doc/api).
==============

Based on [php-github-api](https://github.com/m4tthumphrey/php-github-api) and code from [KnpLabs](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api).

Installation
------------
Install Composer

```
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

Add the following to your require block in composer.json config. Note: be careful when using the `dev-master` tag as this may have unexpected results depending on your version of Gitlab. See the Versioning section below for more information.

```
"m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api": "dev-master"
```

Include Composer's autoloader:


```php
require_once dirname(__DIR__).'/vendor/autoload.php';
```

Versioning
----------

From the 6.0 stable release of Gitlab, I shall now be matching the client version with the Gitlab version. For example when Gitlab 6.1 is released I will release version 6.1.0 of the API client. If I need to make future updates to the client before the next API version is released. I will simply use a 3th build version. For example `6.1.1`, `6.1.2` etc. It is recommended that you keep your composer file up to date depending on what version of Gitlab you are currently running. So if you are using 6.0, you should required `6.0.*`; 6.1 should be `6.1.*` etc etc.

General API Usage
-----------------

```php
$client = new \Gitlab\Client('http://git.yourdomain.com/api/v3/'); // change here
$client->authenticate('your_gitlab_token_here', \Gitlab\Client::AUTH_URL_TOKEN); // change here

$project = $client->api('projects')->create('My Project', array(
  'description' => 'This is a project',
  'issues_enabled' => false
));

```

Model Usage
-----------

You can also use the library in an object oriented manner.

```php
$guzzle = new \Gitlab\HttpClient\Adapter\Guzzle4();
$client = new \Gitlab\Client('http://git.yourdomain.com/api/v3/', $guzzle); // change here
$client->authenticate('your_gitlab_token_here', \Gitlab\HttpClient\HttpClientInterface::AUTH_URL_TOKEN); // change here
```

Creating a new project

```php
$project = \Gitlab\Model\Project::create($client, 'My Project', array(
  'description' => 'This is my project',
  'issues_enabled' => false
));

$project->addHook('http://mydomain.com/hook/push/1');
```

Creating a new issue

```php
$project = new \Gitlab\Model\Project(1, $client);
$issue = $project->createIssue('This does not work..', array(
  'description' => 'This doesnt work properly. Please fix',
  'assignee_id' => 2
));
```

Closing that issue

```php
$issue->close();
```

You get the idea! Take a look around and please feel free to report any bugs.

Integration
------------

- [GitLabApiBundle](https://github.com/Zeichen32/GitLabApiBundle)  Symfony2 Bundle

Contributing
------------

There are many parts of Gitlab that I have not added to this as it was originally created for personal use, hence the lack of tests. Feel free to fork and add new functionality and tests, I'll gladly accept decent pull requests.
